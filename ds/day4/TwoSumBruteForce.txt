Problem Statement: Two Sum (Without Using HashMap)

You are given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`. Your task is to find the indices of two numbers in the array such that their sum equals `target`.  

Constraints:
- The given array may or may not be sorted.  
- You must solve this problem **without using a HashMap**.  
- You **cannot use the same element twice**.  
- Assume there is exactly **one unique solution**.  

Example 1:
Input:
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9

Output:
[0, 1]

Explanation:
- nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9, which matches the target.  
- So, we return [0,1].

Example 2:
Input:
nums = [3, 2, 4], target = 6

Output:
[1, 2]

Explanation:
- nums[1] + nums[2] = 2 + 4 = 6, which matches the target.
