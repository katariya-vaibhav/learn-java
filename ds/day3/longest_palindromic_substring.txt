DSA Problem: Find the Longest Palindromic Substring

Problem Statement:
Given a string s, return the longest palindromic substring in s.

Example 1:
Input: s = "babad"
Output: "bab"
Explanation: "aba" is also a valid answer.

Example 2:
Input: s = "cbbd"
Output: "bb"

Example 3:
Input: s = "a"
Output: "a"

Example 4:
Input: s = "ac"
Output: "a"

Constraints:
- 1 <= s.length <= 1000
- s consists only of printable ASCII characters.

Solution Approach:
1. Iterate through each character and consider it as a center.
2. Expand in both directions while characters match.
3. Keep track of the longest palindrome found.
4. Return the longest palindromic substring.
